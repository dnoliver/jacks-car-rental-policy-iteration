# Problem

This is the link to our reference book from the author’s website, Dr. Richard Sutton:
[http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2020.pdf](http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2020.pdf)\]

Write a program that implements policy iteration to solve Example 4.2: Jack’s Car Rental (page 81). Your implementation
should follow the algorithm given on page 80. You must submit: The code, the results (including any plots, etc.), and a
brief explanation of your approach and findings. [you can use any programming languages]

Write a program to solve Exercise 4.7 (page 81).

If you successfully solve Exercise 4.7 and provide, the code, the results, and a clear explanation (including the
pseudocode), then you will not need to take the final exam and will automatically receive full credit for the final exam
grade. [you can use any programming languages]

Best of luck!
